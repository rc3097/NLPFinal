federer	positive	Federer stays winning. Into the finals tomorrow.
federer	positive	Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first
federer	positive	Way to go Roger. Old man Federer just keeps rolling along. #Djokernole v. #Fed for the final tomorrow. #CincyTennis
federer	positive	Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
federer	positive	@SkySportsNewsHQ the news should be Federer qualifies for 8th Cincinnati final. Not Murray knocked out.
federer	positive	Federer will play another final tomorrow. This guy is just amazing. #CincyTennis
federer	positive	Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!
federer	positive	Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio.
federer	positive	Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
federer	positive	Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
federer	positive	Federer will be 2nd seed at @usopen if he wins this. Djokovic aiming to become 1st player to win all 9 Masters 1000 tournaments #CincyTennis
federer	positive	Federer takes the opener 7-6(1) against Djokovic. Better player in the set &amp; winning plenty behind the 2nd serve. http://t.co/U2hbTK5qMC

federer	positive	@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
federer	positive	All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
federer	positive	@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!

federer	positive	I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!

federer	positive	Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back.
federer	positive	Roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! Federer might face Isner in 4th round

federer	positive	Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
federer	positive	Federer saved 4 BP (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set.
federer	positive	Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
federer	positive	Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
federer	positive	I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
federer	positive	I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
federer	positive	That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el

hannibal	positive	At the ending, there're oysters on Hannibal's table. How considerate Hannibal is ...but c'mon Will needs fishes #Hannibal #HannibalMicDrop
hannibal	positive	ugh also i forgot hannibal is ending...i never kept up with it but i still feel pretty sad it was a damn good show, 1st season
hannibal	positive	ugggggggh I want to watch Hannibal finale but I am too tired. Perhaps when I get up tomorrow I will
hannibal	positive	ok when I'm sober tomorrow I NEED to talk to people about Hannibal
hannibal	positive	I'm just sat here crying over the last episode of Hannibal #bye
hannibal	positive	@afooltocry @HorrorHoneys It's my uneducated opinion that Breaking Bad is the best show in the history of time.Hannibal might now be the 2nd
hannibal	positive	@neoprod @GillianA @NBCHannibal well you can't do this all by yourself ... Hannibal is inviting to Dinner and Will may finally accepting him
hannibal	positive	Hannibal finale on Wednesday in the UK. Time to catch up on all the episodes I missed while on holiday.
hannibal	positive	Tomorrow I will start catching up on Hannibal. I got to ep2 of S3 and had to stop because I wasn't ready for what a ride it was gonna be.
hannibal	positive	We're deep in Season 3 of HANNIBAL and Will Graham may have met his match with The Tooth Fairy http://t.co/aHbA8EnCJG http://t.co/fJP8d00hgs
hannibal	positive	@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
hannibal	positive	@WatIsEyebrow noooo not yet. We had a birthday date night last night. Plus I watch it on hulu, which means no Hannibal until Sunday :/
hannibal	positive	I would've preferred that episode 4 of Hannibal season 3 was the 2nd episode of it. would've been better to check on everyone earlier.
hannibal	positive	According to my DVR, the penultimate episode of HANNIBAL is just the 4th quarter of a NFL preseason game. I could eat a face.
hannibal	positive	I may have a massive love-hate relationship with Hannibal but Bryan Fuller's heart has always been in the right place.
hannibal	positive	I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal
hannibal	positive	Binge watched Hannibal all night and I may have just checked under my bed for a killer. #adultlife
hannibal	negative	I thought I had enough strength for the Hannibal finale. Tomorrow is lost.
hannibal	positive	@wylerette it may be called Hannibal but the show does revolve around the both of them plus bryan said they are meant to stay together
hannibal	positive	We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form
hannibal	negative	@eattherudecast I think it's Hannibal and Clarice on the run together, which I loathed, but Bryan's talk of an "inversion" may make it work
hannibal	negative	I met Em and Blaine through Hannibal. I may have my issues with the show but I'm modest enough to respect that.
hannibal	positive	I'm crying! :O  Thank you @NBCHannibal for giving Hannibal a home for 3 years, and doing your best to keep it there  https://t.co/QJCCTlhNFS
hannibal	negative	Hannibal's 3rd season feels like it became more and more a parody of itself.
hannibal	positive	Tweet from the great state of Denial. New tv show called #Hannibal on thur at 10pm. The guy plyn Hannibal has good cheek bones. Im intrigued
hannibal	positive	Tonights a good stopping point. Tomorrow I watch the last 6 episodes of Hannibal, ie. the Red Dragon arc.

hannibal	positive	@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p
hannibal	positive	@filmgrabber Michael Marshall shot the hell out of the Hannibal finale. (This movie rules. Loving Maddin Monday)

hannibal	positive	@FrygtCanophilis Hannibal removes his hand from your forehead, Will's temperature was back again. He sat down beside the younger man -
hannibal	positive	@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx
hannibal	positive	@TheEricGoldman Seriously, when people lament they didn't take the 1st possible deal for Hannibal, I tell them go watch Lost in La Mancha.

harper	positive	Unpopular opinion:  Harper is right to think Nats fans ditching in the 7th inning was brutal.  No sure he was right to say it though.

harper	negative	@bruceanderson I feel it is 2nd rate. Mansbridge doesn't point out when Harper's not answering the question. Debaters would do that.
