nintendo	positive	Honestly, lack of 3rd party support should have been expected. its not the company's fault for not siding with Nintendo
nintendo	positive	@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
nintendo	positive	@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol
nintendo	positive	@16KTS @Flareonys Nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.

nintendo	positive	@BlazeRuler Nintendo may have wanted to make it E10+, so they left him out. I dunno, probably not true
nintendo	positive	@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
nintendo	positive	It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy
nintendo	positive	Apparently Super Mario Maker comes out on the 11th of September. I guess it's Nintendo's way of saying "just bloody rebuild them already".
